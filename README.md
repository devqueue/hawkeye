# HawkEye
A web based Attandance system built with django using the [django black template](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/black-dashboard-django) by creative tim

<br />

## ✨ Deploy in production using `Docker`

> Get the code

```bash
$ git clone <repo>
$ cd genelookup
```
> Configure environment variables
```
1. Create a .env file and paste the contents. 

DEBUG=1
DB_NAME=dbname
DB_USER=rootuser
DB_PASS=changeme
SECRET_KEY=changeme
ALLOWED_HOSTS=127.0.0.1

2. Change the variables to store real values
3. Allowed hosts can be a comma seperated list of multiple hosts (IP's or domain names)
```
> Start the app in Docker

```bash
$ docker-compose up --build
$ docker-compose run --rm app sh -c "python manage.py createsuperuser"
```

Visit `http://localhost:80` in your browser. The app should be up & running.


<br />

## ✨ How to use it for development
The development deployment provies hot reloading for the code to update in real time

```bash
$ # Get the code
$ git clone <repo>
$ cd genelookup
$
$ 
$ # Docker compose
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up --build
$
$ # open a new terminal and run 
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml run --rm app sh -c "python manage.py createsuperuser"
$
$ # Access the web app in browser: http://127.0.0.1/
```

<br />

## ✨ Code-base structure

The project is coded using a simple and intuitive structure presented below:

```bash
< PROJECT ROOT >

## ✨ Recompile CSS

To recompile SCSS files, follow this setup:

<br />

**Step #1** - Install tools

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) 12.x or higher
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - globally 
    - `npm install -g gulp-cli`
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (optional) 

<br />

**Step #2** - Change the working directory to `assets` folder

```bash
$ cd apps/static/assets
```

<br />

**Step #3** - Install modules (this will create a classic `node_modules` directory)

```bash
$ npm install
// OR
$ yarn
```

<br />

**Step #4** - Edit & Recompile SCSS files 

```bash
$ gulp scss
```

The generated file is saved in `static/assets/css` directory.

<br /> 

## Future improvement proposals
1. Live table update using ajax
2. Testing time complexity with large number of files.
